## Overview

This feature allows you to edit the records in a domain's DNS (Domain Name System) zone file. DNS converts human-readable domain names (for example, `example.com`) to computer-readable IP addresses (for example, `192.0.0.1`). To perform this function, DNS relies on zone records that exist on your server to map domain names to IP addresses.

{{% callout type="warning" header="Important:" %}}
* We **deprecated** the MyDNS and NSD nameserver software in cPanel & WHM version 78 and plan to remove them in a future release. If you use either of these nameservers, we **strongly** recommend that you migrate to either the PowerDNS or BIND namesevers. For more information, read our [cPanel Deprecation Plan](/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-deprecation-plan) documentation.
* DNS zones that reside on other Write-only DNS servers in a DNS cluster do **not** appear in this interface.

## Domains

The _DNS Zone Manager_ interface displays all of your server's domains. To filter the list, enter a name in the text box. For each listed domain, you can perform the following actions:

* _A Record_ — Create a new [A record](#a). When you select this record type, a new window will appear. Enter a valid DNS zone name in the _Name_ text box and a valid IPv4 address in the _Address_ text box. Click _Add An A Record_ to save your changes.
* _CNAME Record_ — Create a new [CNAME record](#cname). When you select this record type, a new window will appear. Enter a valid DNS zone name in the _Name_ text box and a FQDN in the _CNAME_ text box. Click _Add A CNAME Record_ to save your changes.
* _MX Record_ — Create a new [MX record](#mx). When you select this record type, a new window will appear. Enter the record's priority value in the _Priority_ text box and a FQDN in the _Destination_ text box. Click _Add An MX Record_ to save your changes.
* _DNSSEC_ — Manage the domain's [DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)](/knowledge-base/dns/dnssec) records. When you select this record type, the system directs you to the [_View DNSSEC Keys_](#view-dnssec-keys) interface.
* _Manage_ — Add or edit additional domain records. When you select this setting, the system directs you to the [_Manage DNS Zone Records_](#manage-dns-zone-records) interface.

### Manage DNS Zone Records

This interface displays a table with a list of the selected domain's DNS zone records. To filter the list, enter a name in the text box or select an available record type filter.

The record table contains the following information for each record:

* *Name* — The record's name.
* *TTL* — The record's Time to Live (TTL).
* *Type* — The [record's type](#dns-zone-record-types).
* *Record* — The record's information.

### DNS zone record types

When you add or edit a DNS zone record, you can select from the following record types:

##### A

IPv4 Address Record — This record maps hostnames to IPv4 addresses. These records allow DNS servers to identify and locate your website and its various services on the internet. Without appropriate A records, your visitors cannot access your website, FTP site, or email accounts. You can set the following values:

  * *Name* — A new or existing DNS zone name. When you enter a zone name, the system automatically appends the domain name to the zone record. For example, if you create the `user` zone, the system will add the `example.com.` domain information.
  * *Address* — Enter the domain's IP address.

##### AAAA

IPv6 Address Record — This record is the same as an A record, but maps hostnames to IPv6 addresses.

##### AFSDB

Andrew File System Data Base Location — This record provides the location of the domain name's Andrew File System (AFS) database server or Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) authentication server. You can set the following values:

* _Subtype_ — The type of server the record points to. You can use one of the following values:
	* `1` — An AFS location server.
	* `2` — A DCE authentication server.
* _Hostname_ — The domain name of the database server.

##### CAA

Certificate Authority Authorization Record — This record controls which certificate authorities (CA) can issue SSL certificates for a domain.

{{% callout type="info" header="Note:" %}}
* If no CAA records exist for a domain, **all** CAs can issue certificates for that domain. If conflicting CAA records already exist, remove the existing CAA records or add one for the desired CA.
* MyDNS does **not** support this record type.
* The system stores these records in the [RFC 3597](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3597) format.
{{% /callout %}}

You can set the following values:

  * _Issuer Critical Flag_ — Whether the CA will issue an SSL certificate if the CAA Resource Record contains unknown property tags. For more information about CAA record flags, read the [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844) documentation.
    * _0_ — Non-critical. The CA will issue an SSL certificate if the CAA Resource Record contains unknown property tags.
    * _1_ — Critical. The CA will **not** issue an SSL certificate if the CAA Resource Record contains unknown property tags.
  * _Tag_ — The CAA record's property type:
    * _issue_ — Authorize a CA to issue a certificate for the domain.
    * _issuewild_ — Authorize a CA to issue a wildcard certificate for the domain.
    * _iodef_ — Specify a URL to which a CA may report policy violations.
  * _Value_ — The CA's domain, or the CA's URL if you select the _iodef_ setting in the _Tag_ section.

##### CNAME

Canonical Name Record — This record creates an alias for another domain name, which DNS resolves. This is useful, for example, if you point multiple CNAME records to a single [A record](#a) in order to simplify DNS maintenance. You can set the following values:

  * _Name_ — A new or existing DNS zone name. When you enter a zone name, the system automatically appends the domain name to the zone record. For example, if you create the `user` zone, the system will add the `example.com.` domain information.
  * _Record_ — Enter a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, the `example2.com` domain. You cannot point a CNAME record to an IP address.

##### DMARC

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance — This record indicates the action for a mail server to take when it receives an email from this domain, but that message fails Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) checks.

When you select this setting, the system creates a [TXT record](#txt) with a default DMARC record. The system also displays a form that allows you to define the domain's DMARC _Policy_ (_None_, _Quarantine_, or _Reject_), as well as the following optional parameters:

  * _Subdomain Policy_ — The action the mail server will take when it receives an email from the domain's subdomain. The server only takes this action if the email fails its SPF and DKIM checks.
    * _None_ — Do not take any action.
    * _Quarantine_ — Send spam email to a different folder on the account.
    * _Reject_ — Reject spam email.
  * _DKIM Mode_ — The DKIM level that the server enforces for the domain. An email must have a valid DKIM signature. The server will check a DKIM signature against the email's `From:` domain entry. You can set the following identifier alignment settings:
    * _Relaxed_ — Only the organizational domains must match. For example, an email from the `domain.example.com` subdomain of `example.com` would pass the DKIM check.
    * _Strict_ — The domains **must** match exactly. For example, the server will accept email from the `example.com` domain, but it would reject email from the `domain.example.com` subdomain.
  * _SPF Mode_ — The SPF level that the server will enforce for the domain. The server sending email must pass SPF authorization. The server checks the server sending an email with the SMTP `MAIL FROM` command. The server then checks the `MAIL FROM` domain entry against the email's `From:` domain entry. You can set the following identifier alignment settings:
    * _Relaxed_ — Only the organizational domains must match. For example, an email from the `domain.example.com` subdomain of `example.com` would pass the SPF check.
    * _Strict_ — The domains **must** match exactly. For example, the server will only accept email if the domain is `example.com`. It would reject an email from the `domain.example.com` domain.
  * _Percentage_ — The percentage of emails that you want the server to filter.
  * _Generate Failure Reports When_ — The error reporting policy between the sender and receiver's Mail Transfer Agents.
  * _Report Format_ — The format that the server uses to report an email's possible spam status.
  * _Report Interval_ — The amount of time, in seconds, that elapse between each aggregate email report. This parameter's value defaults to `86400`.
  {{% callout type="info" header="Note:" %}}
  This value does **not** include email failure messages.
  {{% /callout %}}
  * _Send Aggregate Mail Reports To_ — A comma-separated list of [Uniform Resource Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) (URIs) to which to send the aggregate email reports. If your URI includes a comma, you **must** URI-encode the comma. To add a size limit for the report, include an exclamation point, a number, and a file size unit to the end of the URI. For example: `mailto:reports@example.com!50m`. You can specify the following file size units:
    * `k` — Kilobytes.
    * `m` — Megabytes.
    * `g` — Gigabytes.
    * `t` — Terabytes.
  * _Send Failure Reports To_ — A comma-separated list of URIs to which to send failure email reports.

##### DNAME

Delegation Name — This record sets an alias for an entire DNS name space. This differs from the CNAME record, which only provides an alias for a single name.

##### DS

Delegation Signer — This record identifies the DNSSEC signing key of a delegation zone. You can obtain this information from your domain's registrar.

{{% callout type="warning" header="Important:" %}}
This record type does **not** update the information with your registrar.
{{% /callout %}}

You can set the following values:

* _Key tag_ — The key tag of the DNSKEY the DS record refers to, in network byte order.

Mail Exchanger — This record identifies the servers that handle a domain's email. Changes that you make to this record control where the server delivers a domain's email. You can set the following values:

  * _Priority_ — Identifies the servers that handle a domain's email. This value for each MX record determines the order in which other mail servers will use the domain's mail server. A lower value indicates a higher priority level. A value of `0` indicates the highest priority level.
  * _Destination_ — The mail server. This must be a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).

##### NAPTR

Naming Authority Pointer — This record specifies a regular-expression-based rewriting rule. This creates a domain label to use with lookup services that aren't in domain name syntax. You can set the following values:

* _Order_ — A 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the order that the NAPTR records process. Low numbers process before high numbers.
* _Preference_ — A 16-bit unsigned integer. This value sets the order in which two or more records with identical _Order_ values process. Low numbers process before high numbers.
* _Flags_ — A flag that controls how NAPTR uses the query output. You can use one of the following flags: `S`, `A`, `U`, or `P`.
* _Service_ — A string that specifies the protocol and service available on the rewrite path.
* _Regexp_ — A string that contains the regex expression to find the next domain lookup.
* _Replacement_ — The next fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to query. This action depends on the _Flags_ field.

##### NS

Name Server Record — This record delegates a DNS zone to use the specified authoritative name server. This must be a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).

##### PTR

PTR Resource Record — This record provides a pointer to a canonical name. Unlike the CNAME record, DNS processing stops and **only** returns the name. This is most commonly used to implement reverse DNS lookups.

##### RP

Responsible Person — This record provides information about the person responsible for the domain. You can set the following values:

* _Mbox-dname_ — The responsible person's email address. Replace the `@` in the email address with a period (`.`) character. This entry **must** end in a period (`.`) if you use a fully-qualified domain name.
* _Txt-dname_ — A related hostname or domain name for which [TXT](#TXT) records exist. This entry **must** end in a period (`.`).

##### SOA

Start of Authority Record — This record specifies the authoritative information about a DNS zone. This includes the following information:

##### SRV

Service Record — This record provides data about available services on specific ports on your server. You can set the following values:

  * _Priority_ — The service record's priority value. A lower value indicates a higher priority level. A value of `0` indicates the highest priority level.
  * _Weight_ — This value ranks entries that share the same _Priority_ value. For example, a record with a `0` priority level and an `8` weight value will rank lower than a record with a `0` priority level and `4` weight value.
  * _Port_ — The service's target port number.
  * _Target_ — The service's target hostname.

##### TXT

Text Record — This record contains text data for various services to read. For example, TXT records can specify data for SPF, DKIM, or DMARC email authentication. You can use WHM's [_Email Deliverability_](/whm/email/email-deliverability-in-whm) interface (_WHM >> Home >> Email >> Email Deliverability_) to manage your server's SPF and DKIM records.
