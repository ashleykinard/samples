## Overview

The `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/sync_child_accounts` script lets you synchronize the user configuration of a [distributed cPanel account](/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary#distributed-cpanel-account). You can use this script when a cPanel account's user configuration falls out of sync between the [parent node](/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary#parent-node) and its [child nodes](/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary#child-node). In most cases, you should not need to run this script. However, running this script for a synchronized account will **not** make any unwanted changes to a cPanel account.

## Run the script

To run this script on the command line, use the following format:
