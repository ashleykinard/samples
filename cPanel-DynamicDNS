## Overview

Use this interface to utilize a Domain Name System (DNS) hosted on the cPanel server to resolve a hostname that exists on an external network with a dynamic IP address. A dynamic IP address changes, while a static IP address stays the same. This feature lets you manage your network devices without the need to manually update their settings any time the IP address changes.

The following steps provide a brief summary of how this feature works:

1. Click *Create* to add a domain, for example, `home.example.com`.
2. The interface creates a unique URL ([webcall](/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary#webcall)) for your new dynamic DNS domain. Use this URL to configure your device.
3. When your device calls the webcall URL, the server automatically sets the domain's IP address to your device's public IP address.

For example, you can use this feature to have cPanel host a DNS for a hostname that points to your office network's public IP address. When the IP address changes, the network will automatically update the DNS.

To use this feature, your hosting provider must perform the following actions:

* Configure nameservers for the active domains on your cPanel account in WHM's [*DNS Cluster*](/whm/clusters/dns-cluster) interface (*WHM >> Home >> Clusters >> DNS Cluster*).
* [Register nameservers](/knowledge-base/dns/how-to-set-up-nameservers-in-a-cpanel-environment/) for the active domains on your cPanel account.
  * You **must** configure your cPanel account's active domains to use the nameservers that your hosting provider registers in cPanel's [*Zone Editor*](/cpanel/domains/zone-editor/) interface (*cPanel >> Home >> Domains >> Zone Editor*).

## The Dynamic DNS (DDNS) interface table

The *Dynamic DNS* interface displays a table that contains your DDNS domains and their information. You can also perform actions for the domains that you select. The table contains the following information:

* *Domain* — The DDNS domain that you can navigate to in your browser. This will also display the DDNS domain's description, if one exists. You can also click a domain in this column to view the following options:
  * *Description* — Use this text box to add or update a DDNS domain's description. Click *Save* to apply your changes or *Cancel* to discard your changes.
  * *Last Update Time* — The most recent time when the IP address changed for the DDNS domain.
  * *Last Run Time* — The most recent time when a request to update the IP address happened. If the IP address stays the same between requests, the server keeps the domain's IP address the same.
* *IP Address* — The IPv4 or IPv6 address or addresses that the DDNS domain resolves to. This IP address synchronizes with the dynamic IP address of the network's router.
* *URL* — The [webcall](/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary#webcall) URL. The device on your dynamic IP address network calls this URL to update the IP address for the DDNS domain.
* *SSL Certificate* — The SSL certificate for the DDNS domain, if available. To view or copy the certificate, click *View SSL Certificate*.

### Create a new DDNS domain

To create a new DDNS domain, click *Create*. The *Create Dynamic DNS Domain* interface will appear. Then, perform the following steps:
   
1. Enter a unique subdomain in the *Dynamic DNS Domain* text box. Then, select a domain from the menu.
2. To add an IP address, click *Manually Enter an IP Address*. Then, enter a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
  {{% callout type="info" header="Note:" %}}
  This IP address will update when you configure your router or device.
  {{% /callout %}}
3. Enter an optional description to help you identify the new DDNS domain.
4. If you want to create another domain, select the *Stay on this page after I click "Create"* checkbox. Otherwise, click *Create* to save your changes.
5. After creating the new DDNS domain, add the new webcall URL to your router or device's configuration.

### Manage a DDNS domain

To update a webcall URL or delete a DDNS domain, perform the following steps:

1. Select the checkbox of each domain you want to modify.
2. Click *Action*.
3. Select one of the following options:
   * *Recreate URL* — This option generates a new webcall URL for the DDNS domain.
   * *Delete* — This option will remove the DDNS domain. Click *Delete* to confirm.
   {{% callout type="warning" header="Important:" %}}
   * You **cannot** undo this action.
   * Deleting a DDNS domain does **not** delete its SSL certificate.

### View SSL Certificate

{{% callout type="warning" header="Important:" %}}
We **strongly** recommend that you use a secure connection to your router or device.
{{% /callout %}}

To view the contents of a DDNS domain's SSL certificate, click *View SSL Certificate*. A new interface will appear. You can then copy the SSL certificate's contents to your DDNS-enabled device.

{{% callout type="info" header="Note:" %}}
Each device's interface is unique. Consult your device's documentation for specific installation instructions.
{{% /callout %}}

On the device that you are configuring for DDNS, search for a tab called *HTTPS*, *DDNS*, or *SSL/TLS Certificate*, or something similar. This tab could be in an *Advanced* or *WAN* menu. You can copy the contents of the text boxes from this interface into your device's text boxes.

#### Manage a DDNS domain's SSL certificate

Use cPanel's [*SSL/TLS Status*](/cpanel/security/ssl-tls-status/) interface (*cPanel >> Home >> Security >> SSL/TLS*) to:

  * Check the status of your DDNS domain's certificate.
  * Request a new SSL certificate for a DDNS domain.

You can also use the *SSL/TLS Status* interface if your DDNS domain displays the *No certificate available for this domain* message.
