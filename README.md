## Professional Portfolio

The following are samples of work I created and contributed to the [cPanel & WHM](https://www.cpanel.net) product:

### cPanel Linked Nodes Guide

* [URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/cpanel-linked-nodes-guide/)
* [Markdown](cPanel-LinkedNodesGuide)
* [PDF](cPanel-LinkedNodesGuide.pdf)

The creation of this particular guide was borne out of necessity to provide detailed information about cPanel's *Linked Nodes* feature to system administrators. The information was considered important, but did not have its place in any existing documentation, nor did it have a place in any related interface documentation.

### Guide to the Manage2 API

* [URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/knowledge-base/guide-to-the-manage2-api/)
* [Markdown](GuidetotheManage2API)
* [PDF](GuidetotheManage2API.pdf)

This document describes the Manage2 API and its usage. This document required me to perform a substantial overhaul from its previous iteration on our old Confluence-based documentation.

### Manage2 API documentation

* [URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/api/manage2-api-add-licenses/)
* [Markdown](Manage2APIFunction-AddLicenses.pdf)
* [PDF](Manage2APIFunctions-AddLicenses)

This document outlines the Manage2 API *Add Licenses* function. Because the Manage2 API is not part of the cPanel & WHM product, I had to migrate this documentation to Hugo and create a specific format for its publication.

### cPanel Tutorials - Mailing Lists Video

* [URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmot-5sgdj4&t)

A sample of a tutorial video produced for cPanel's [Mailing Lists](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/mailing-lists/) interface.

### Other Sample Work
The following are sample documents created as part of this professional portfolio:

* [AddLicense API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ashleykinard/addlicense/1.0.0) - An OpenAPI mockup of an "Add License" API document.
* [Logging Your Shift in Workday](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/WorkdaySample.pdf) - A mockup of using the *Workday* software to log a shift.
