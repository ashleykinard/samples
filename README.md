# Professional Portfolio

The following are samples of work I created and contributed to the [cPanel & WHM](https://www.cpanel.net) product:
#### cPanel Linked Nodes Guide

[Markdown]([https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/cPanel Linked Nodes Guide](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/cPanel-LinkedNodesGuide)) -- [PDF]([https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/cPanel Linked Nodes Guide](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/cPanel-LinkedNodesGuide).pdf)

The creation of this particular guide was borne out of necessity to provide detailed information about cPanel's *Linked Nodes* feature to system administrators. The information was considered important, but did not have its place in any existing documentation, nor did it have a place in any related interface documentation.

### Other Sample Work
The following are sample documents created as part of this professional portfolio:

* [Logging Your Shift in Workday](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/WorkdaySample.pdf) - A mockup of using the *Workday* software to log a shift.
